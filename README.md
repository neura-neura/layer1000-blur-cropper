# Layer 1000

**Layer 1000** is a lightweight, browser-based tool that converts any image into a clean, square **1000 × 1000** canvas.  
If the input image is not square, the background is automatically filled using a blurred, scaled version of the same image, creating a seamless and polished result.

Everything runs locally on your device. No files are uploaded to any server.

## Features

- Load any image (JPG, PNG).
- Automatically generates a **1000 × 1000 px** output.
- Non-square images are centered, while the background is filled with a blurred version of the original.
- Real-time blur adjustment with a responsive preview.
- One-click download of the final image (PNG format).
- Clean, modern, fully responsive interface.
- Entirely client-side, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
